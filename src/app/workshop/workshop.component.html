            >In the artificial intelligence (AI) era, computer vision is
            revolutionizing how machines see the world, and mathematical imaging
            techniques are at the forefront of this revolution. Our hands-on
            workshop in MATLAB covers the essential mathematical methods driving
            this field, from image restoration, segmentation, feature extraction
            to classification. These techniques are the building blocks of
            computer vision systems that power AI applications across
            industries. Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or developer,
            this course provides the tools you need to excel in this area. Donâ€™t
            miss this chance to deepen your expertise in a field where
            mathematics and AI converge. Register now and elevate your
            career!</small

            Discover the theory of fuzzy systems and their practical
            applications in this interactive workshop. Participants will gain
            hands-on experience in designing and implementing fuzzy
            decision-making models using the Matlab Toolbox, Juzzy Online in
            Java, and the FuzzyR package in R. This workshop provides practical
            insights into creating intelligent and interpretable systems, with
            opportunities to apply these techniques to various decision-making
            challenges, including medical diagnosis, selection and evaluation
            tasks, and agricultural decision-making, among others.

            The workshop will begin with an overview of machine learning and its
            key concepts, emphasizing the mathematical foundations necessary for
            understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms. The
            workshop then will delved into linear regression, covering both the
            theoretical aspects, mathematical formulation, assumptions and
            practical implementation (coding and evaluating models). This
            workshop session will also include hands-on activities to apply the
            concepts that is learned. Participants will explore how to integrate
            mathematical principles with machine learning applications through
            case studies and an interactive project. Participants gained
            practical experience in applying linear regression to real-world
            data. The workshop will finally concluded with a discussion on
            specific topics and an open Q&A session, providing participants with
            a comprehensive understanding of how mathematics and machine
            learning intersect and how to further develop their skills. This
            workshop structure ensures a balance between theoretical
            understanding, practical application, and hands-on experience,
            giving participants a solid foundation in integrating mathematics
            with machine learning.
